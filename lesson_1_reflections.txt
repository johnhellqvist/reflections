# viewing a diff helped by narrowing my search down
# to just those elements that had changed between the files

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
# having a copy of all the changes you've made make sit easier to
# restore something that's been deleted, if you realise you've made a 
# mistake

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
# The pros of manually commiting are being able to choose when is
# aprropriate to save a version, so that, for example, a version isn't
# saved where you're halfway through fixing something, or writing a word.
# Cons include possibly forgetting to commit soon enough once working on 
# some changes.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
# It depends on what each VCS is used for. Since with programming, files 
# are often linked together, and changes can be made to multiple files in
# one commit to effect one change, it makes most sense to save multiple 
# files in one commit. In other contexts however, such as saving regular 
# documents, it makes much mor sense to save single files, as they're 
# most often not linked, and it's much simpler to do so and keep track of
# in that way.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
# I can use git log to view the id and commit message of each commit in the repository, and git diff can be used to view the differences between two commit versions

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
# since you can always go back to a previous version, there is little to 
# lose by making changes, other than time.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
# everything concerning programming where the file is large enough to 
# warrant it!
