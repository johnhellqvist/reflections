What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
# A .git folder is created containing the information for the repository.
# Without this initialising step, this .git information is not created,
# and there is no way of tracking your files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
# The staging area is an intermediate area where you can choose to add 
# files before commiting them. It's useful because this way, you don't
# need to commit all the files in the working directory at once, and 
# can have untracked files if need be.
