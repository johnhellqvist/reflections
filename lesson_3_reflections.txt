When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
# You would want to use a remote repository when collaborating with others, 
# when you want to access the information from different locations or computers,
# or when you want to share your work with the public.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
# In case you don't want the changes that have been pushed to GitHub. There are a number 
# of examples when this might be the case. For example, if you're collaborating with
# others, and you're working on different features, if Git automatically pulls the 
# changes, it may overwrite files you are working on, or may break the feature you are
# working on by changing the other files.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
# A branch is another version of the project you are working on, within the repository.
# A clone is a complete copy of a repository on your local machine.
# A fork is a complete copy of someone else's repository on GitHub only.
